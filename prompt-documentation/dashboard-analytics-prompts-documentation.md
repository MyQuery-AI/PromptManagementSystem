**Location:** `app\(themed)\(SignedIn)\(dashboard)\dashboard-builder\_open-ai-actions\prompts\dashboard-analytics-prompts.ts`

### Purpose

The dashboard analytics prompts system provides advanced analytical capabilities to extract key statistics and insights from dashboard charts. The system uses a structured 4D framework (Discover, Decompose, Determine, Describe) to ensure comprehensive and actionable analysis.

## Core Functions

### 1. getDashboardStatsSystemPrompt()

**Type:** Analytics Expert System for Statistics Generation
**Purpose:** Creates exactly 4 key numeric statistics that summarize the most important metrics

#### 4D Analysis Framework

**1. DISCOVER: Examine the dashboard context**

- Identify the dashboard's primary purpose and audience
- Recognize the business domain (sales, marketing, operations, etc.)
- Note the types of charts and their relationships
- Assess data completeness and quality

**2. DECOMPOSE: Break down the available data**

- Identify key metrics present in the charts
- Recognize time periods or comparison groups
- Identify categorical vs. numerical data
- Note correlations or relationships between metrics

**3. DETERMINE: Select the most valuable statistics**

- Prioritize metrics that support business decisions
- Select metrics that complement each other for a complete view
- Choose metrics that highlight key trends, patterns, or anomalies
- Include a mix of volume, ratio, and change-over-time metrics

**4. DESCRIBE: Present statistics with context and meaning**

- Name each statistic clearly and descriptively
- Provide appropriate numerical formatting
- Include directional indicators (trend)
- Use relevant emojis that enhance understanding

#### Output Structure

**Required Fields:**

```json
{
  "id": "string (unique identifier)",
  "title": "string (the metric name)",
  "value": "number (the actual numeric value)",
  "trend": "up|down|stable (optional)",
  "emoji": "string (a single emoji that best represents this metric)"
}
```

#### Emoji Guidelines

**Appropriate Emoji Selection:**

- üìà for growth or increases
- üí∞ for revenue or financial metrics
- üë• for user-related metrics
- ‚ö° for performance metrics
- üéØ for conversion or goal-related metrics
- üìä for general statistics
- üîÑ for activity or usage metrics
- ‚è±Ô∏è for time-based metrics
- üì± for mobile or device metrics
- üåü for ratings or satisfaction metrics

#### Insufficient Data Handling

**When charts data is insufficient, empty, or unsuitable:**

1. Do NOT return an error
2. Analyze chart titles and types to infer valuable statistics
3. Create placeholder statistics based on apparent dashboard purpose
4. Include note indicating "recommended metric" rather than actual data
5. Suggest what tables or data fields would be needed for actual values

### 2. getDashboardInsightsSystemPrompt()

**Type:** Analytics Expert System for Insights Generation
**Purpose:** Generates meaningful insights about patterns, trends, and relationships in data

#### 4D Analysis Framework for Insights

**1. DISCOVER: Examine the dashboard context and data patterns**

- Identify the overall business domain and purpose
- Observe data distributions, ranges, and outliers
- Look for visible trends, seasonal patterns, or cycles
- Note relationships between different metrics
- Assess data quality, completeness, and limitations

**2. DECOMPOSE: Break down the observations systematically**

- Segment trends by time periods, categories, or demographics
- Compare different metrics against each other
- Identify top and bottom performers
- Isolate anomalies and their potential causes
- Recognize correlations and potential causal relationships

**3. DETERMINE: Prioritize insights by business impact**

- Focus on insights that drive decision-making
- Highlight patterns that require immediate attention
- Emphasize unexpected or counter-intuitive findings
- Consider both positive opportunities and concerning risks
- Evaluate the statistical significance of patterns

**4. DESCRIBE: Articulate insights with clarity and context**

- State each insight in business terms, not technical language
- Explain why the insight matters (business impact)
- Suggest possible actions or next steps
- Indicate confidence level and limitations
- Link insights to specific charts or data points

#### Insights Output Structure

**Required Fields:**

```json

  "relatedChartIds": ["string"] (optional array of chart IDs)
}
```

#### Insight Types

**Trend:** Patterns showing change over time
**Comparison:** Relative performance between categories/groups
**Anomaly:** Unusual or unexpected data points
**Correlation:** Relationships between different metrics
**Pattern:** Recurring behaviors or cycles

#### Severity Levels

**Info:** General observations and positive trends
