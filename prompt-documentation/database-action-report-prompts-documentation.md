**4. Recommendations:** Actionable next steps prioritized by impact
**5. Technical Appendix:** Detailed metrics and dialect-specific proof points

#### Mandatory Safeguards

**Security Restrictions:**

- NEVER expose: Connection strings, raw credentials, internal IPs

- FLAG for immediate attention: Security policy violations

**High-Risk Scenarios:**

- Cross-schema dependencies with potential cascading failures
- Operations without backup/rollback capability
- Privilege escalation risks or security policy violations
- Destructive operations in production without proper approvals
