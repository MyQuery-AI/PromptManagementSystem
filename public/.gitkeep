# Public Directory

This directory contains static assets that will be served directly by Next.js.
Files in this directory are served from the root path `/`.

For example:

- `public/logo.png` will be served at `/logo.png`
- `public/images/hero.jpg` will be served at `/images/hero.jpg`

Note: In Next.js 13+ with the App Router, favicons should be placed in the `app` directory as `favicon.ico`.
